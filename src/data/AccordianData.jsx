    question: "How do I buy Solana?",
    answer: `Solana also known as SOL is a cryptocurrency. This project will be on the Solana Blockchain.
      As a newbie in the crypto space we recommend that you sign up to Binance.com on your desktop.
      You will need to buy Solana first using your local currency (USD, HKD, GBP etc)
      Click on "Buy Now" on the home page
      Select your local currency (in the example below I selected USD) on "Spend" and select "USDT" for "Receive". Select the amount you want to spend on our NFT. Then click continue.
      Once you have USDT, click on "convert"
      Here, you will need to convert your USDT to Solana (SOL) &rarr click "Preview Conversion" and proceed.
      Then Congrats! you now have Solana (SOL) to buy your first NFT!
      
      Here's how to send Solana from your Binance wallet to your Phantom wallet:
      Create a Phantom wallet https://phantom.app and add it to your Chrome (Phantom wallet is a Solana wallet, it is only available on your desktop for now, they will launch on mobile early next year - now you know how early you are in this space! is going to explode!)
      In your Phantom wallet, you can click on the long number at the top (which is your unique ID of your wallet) and it will automatically copy the number
      Go back on your Binance, click on "Wallet" â†’ "Overview" â†’ "Withdraw" â†’
      - Select coin, select "SOL"
      - Address, make sure to paste your Phantom wallet address here (double check)
      - Network, make sure to select "SOL" as the network
      - Select the amount of SOL you want to withdraw and then click withdraw
      Give it a few seconds/sometimes minutes, and check your Phantom wallet. Your SOL should be available on your Phantom wallet now!
      Head over the secondary markets and buy your favourite Kittens!
      Magic Eden, Alpha Art or Moonverse`,
